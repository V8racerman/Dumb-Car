Uses the L293D 4 channel motor shield.  This motor shield was discontinued by Adafruit several years ago,
but clones can be readily purchased on platforms such as eBay and Ali Express.

The motor shield relies on the Adafruit Motor Shield Library (V1), which is still available within the Arduino IDE (or on GitHub)
